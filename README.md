# Simple convolutional neural network to perform classification

## Overview
This project implements a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify waste materials into nine categories using the **RealWaste** dataset. The objective is to develop an image classification model capable of recognizing various waste types in a landfill environment.

### Categories
The dataset includes the following classes:
- Cardboard
- Food Organics
- Glass
- Metal
- Miscellaneous Trash
- Paper
- Plastic
- Textile Trash
- Vegetation
